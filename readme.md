# Julie's dotfiles

Originally cloned, stripped and modified from [Paul Irish's dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles/) with some further customizations.

## Install

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `./sync.sh` and confirm deletion of existing files when prompted.

## Customizations

![Preview](./screenshot.png)

### Powerline Fonts

https://github.com/powerline/fonts

### Color Theme - Argonaut

### VS Code Settings

### [zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) 
  
I have customized **[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)** [🚀 spaceship](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt) theme to look like the [pure prompt](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) I previously used, but discarded because it [mangled pinentry prompts](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure/issues/366).

### [z jumper](https://github.com/rupa/z)
  

Lets me [jump around in history without knowing/typing entire path](https://github.com/rupa/z), for example:

```
$ z dotfiles

# Hit Tab, Enter and you're there
$ ~/Code/dotfiles
```

## Mac Adjustments

### Git - Disable OS X Keychain

Mac OS by default wants to use the OS X keychain. But I want to use `git-credential-netr`. So create a blank config to override system default:

```
touch /usr/local/etc/gitconfig
```

Yep, it's supposed to be empty.

### Big Sur 🤦‍♀️

After every tiny OS update, need to re-run:

```
xcode-select --install
```
